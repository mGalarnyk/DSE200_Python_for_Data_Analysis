    "##What is it?\n",
    "\n",
    "A large portion of the data that we as social scientists are interested in resides on the web in manner. Web scraping is a method for pulling data from the structured (or not so structured!) HTML that makes up a web page. Python has numerous libraries for approaching this type of problem, many of which are incredibly powerful. If there is something you want to do, there's usually a way to accomplish it. Perhaps not easily, but it can be done. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##How is it accomplished?\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, there are three problems that you might face when undertaking a scraping task:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. You have a single page, or a set of pages, that you know of and you want to scrape.\n",
    "2. You have a source that generates links, e.g., [RSS feeds](http://rss.nytimes.com/services/xml/rss/nyt/World.xml), to various pages with the same structure.\n",
    "3. You have a page that contains many pages of interest that are scattered across the file system and you only have general rules for reaching these pages. \n",
    "\n",
    "The key is that you must identify which type of problem you have. After this, you must look at the HTML structure of a webpage and construct a script that will select the parts of the page that are of interest to you.\n",
    "\n",
    "##There's a library for that! \n",

Using `pattern`'s `Newsfeed()` method, it is possible to parse a feed and obtain attributes of the XML document. The `search()` method returns an iterable composed of the individual stories. Each result has a variety of attributes such as `.url`, `.title`, `.description`, and more. The following code demonstrates these methods."
